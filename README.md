### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data to uncover key insights that support decision-making in an organization. Using Excel, I transformed raw HR data into an interactive dashboard that highlights performance trends, productivity metrics, and key workforce patterns.
### Problem Statement
Companies depend on employees to perform well, but many organizations struggle to understand why performance goes up or down. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify low-performing departments, recognize top performers, or make decisions that improve overall productivity.
The objective of this project is to analyze employee performance data and uncover meaningful insights such as:
- Which departments are performing well or struggling
- How factors like experience, education level or job role affect performance
- Does training improve performance
- Key areas where management needs to take action
- The recruitment channel that produce the highest performing employees
This analysis helps the organization make more informed decisions, improve employee engagement, and boost overall performance.
### Process
1. Data Collection
- Downloaded employee performance data from Kaggle, which included information on employee_id,department, region, education,	gender,	recruitment_channel ,no_of_trainings, age, previous_year_rating, length_of_service, KPIs_met_more_than_80	awards_won, avg_training_score.
2. Data Cleaning
- Used Power Query in Excel to clean the data:
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Handled missing or inconsistent values
- Standardized formats for dates and text fields
3. Calculating Key Metrics
- Used DAX formulas in to calculate key performance metrics such as:
- Average Training score
- Average Employee Rating
- KPIs Achievers
- Total Employees
-% of Award Winners
4. Pivot Table Analysis
- Created Pivot Tables to summarize and explore the data, making it easier to identify which departments are performing well or struggling, key areas where management needs to take action, the recruitment channel that produce the highest performing employees and education level comparisons.
5. Visualization
- Built interactive dashboards to present insights using charts, slicers, and KPI cards.
- Highlighted top-performing and underperforming employees for actionable insights.
### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel; Data cleaning and Visualization
### Key Insights
- Only 35.88% of employees currently meet expected performance levels, indicating an opportunity to strengthen development and performance support.
- Employees hired through referrals show the highest performance, reinforcing that internal networks can be a strong recruitment channel.
- Performance increases with years of service, highlighting the importance of employee retention and structured onboarding.
- The workforce is highly educated, with a large share holding Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
- Training scores are similar across performance levels, suggesting current training programs may not be strongly influencing results.
